### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Darshan Mistry. For the last 14 months, I have been a DevOps Engineer at Borndigital. Managing AWS, GCP, and manages all servers deploy in the company with good network handling. I have worked closely with my project manager and other seniors and build some key relationships. I have completed a professional DevOps course from IBM and I get a certificate from IBM. I have done some courses from udemy so it will help me with my works. Altho I love my current experience, I feel I'm now ready for a more challenging assignment and this position excites me.
